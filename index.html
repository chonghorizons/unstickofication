      <p>
        Welcome to Get Unstuck. This is proven method to get you unstuck in a BIG (or little) goal you have that takes time to get to. Things like getting fit. Eating better. Working on a project. Practicing Violin. Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: This is not for habit formation (like flossing, things that take very little time but you want to keep doing). For that, you gotta wait for my forthcoming hait formation app.

      <h2>The Method - described</h2>
      <p>
        The method is called 30-10-30-10-30. This is because it is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          30 minutes of do-it!
        </li>
        <li>
          10 minutes of break/rest/reward/treat.
        </li>
        <li>
          30 minutes of do-it!
        </li>
        <li>
          10 minutes of break/rest/reward/treat.
        </li>
        <li>
          30 minutes of do-it!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It works because you break up the "work" and the "treat". Those people who say "the work is the reward"... well they can go climb Mt Everest and go skydiving while taking the LSAT. For the rest of us, work is drudgery, especially getting started.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, 30-10-30-10-30 puts a light at the end of the tunnel. And the middle. And the front. You work for 30 (work, hard). Then 10 minutes of break/treat. Your brain won't be spooked because you'll see the break coming up. Knowing there is a break, the idea is you can put up with "work" for 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If 30 minutes sounds like too long, for now, just trust us. We'll adjust this up or down depending on where you are. 30 is a good start.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we go too far.... let's get to the work and the treats.

      <h2>Chunks & treats</h2>

    <p>
       Chunks are small things you can do to make progress. It should be something real and measureable.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOT OK: Think about how to exercise
    </p>
    <p>
      OK!: Write down things to exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      OK!: Go to gym.

    <p>
      OK!: Walk to the mailbox and back.

      Let's review. We wasted, errr, spent about 2-5 minutes setting you up. It's not wasted because we were removing the resistance most people have about getting started. (That's why you are here... you were stuck. Let's get unstuck!)
